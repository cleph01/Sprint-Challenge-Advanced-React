 Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

    - To be able to use the lifecycle methods for specific objectives.  These methods 
    (known as life cycle hooks) give us control into how our components work.

 Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

    - componentDidMount, shouldComponentUpdate, componentWillUnmount

 What is the purpose of a custom hook?

    - They allow you to apply non-visual behavior and stateful logic throughout 
    your components by reusing the same hook over and over again.

 Why is it important to test our apps?

    - In terms of benefits, testing:

        * Surfaces bugs faster.
        * Reduces the risk of regressions.
        * Allows us to trust the code.
        * Makes us think about the edge cases.
        * Acts as a safety net when making changes or refactoring.
        * Acts as documentation for the code.
        * Encourages us to write more testable (better!) code.
    
    - On the other hand, NOT testing:

        * Forces to use very expensive manual testing.
        * Causes bugs and edge cases to be encountered later.
        * Makes refactoring or adding features risky and scary.
        * Can make codebases fragile and expensive to maintain.
        * Makes less documented codebases much harder to understand.
